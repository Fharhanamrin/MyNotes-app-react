# MyNotes Application

## Description

MyNotes is a simple note-taking application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and archive notes. The app is designed with an intuitive interface, making it easy for anyone to use.

## Main Features

* **Add Note:** Users can add a new note with a title and content.
* **Edit Note:** Notes that have been created can be edited at any time.
* **Delete Note:** Users can delete notes that are no longer needed.
* **Archive Note:** Notes that are no longer active can be moved to the archive to keep the main list clean.
* **Unarchive Note:** Archived notes can be restored at any time.

## Application Architecture

The application is built with a component-based architecture:

* **UI Layer:** Displays the list of notes and action buttons (Add, Edit, Delete, Archive).
* **Data Layer:** Manages note data using state management or local database.
* **Logic Layer:** Handles the logic for adding, editing, deleting, and archiving notes.
